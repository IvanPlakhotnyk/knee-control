## Report notes

The purpose of this report is to identify markers for event detection that correlate to a change in walking speed. The Russell knee joint is a mechanical knee which mimics the movement of the human knee in the sagittal plane.

## The Russel knee joint

It has also been shown that the mechanical structure of the human knee, two condyles connected with ligaments, has some mechanical advantages over a simple pin joint [3]. There is, however, no current robust method for estimating the angle of such a joint for use in a controller since the polycentric nature of the joint makes the incorporation of potentiometers or encoders into the mechanism challenging.

A layer of smooth cartilage covers the femoral and tibial condyles which allows low friction sliding between the joint surfaces.

The four ligaments are the anterior crutiate ligament (ACL) and posterior crutiate ligament (PCL) - these are found in the centre of the knee (Figure 1) - and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL) which are found on the sides of the joint.

There is evidence from microscope observations that there are mechanoreceptors present within the ligaments [9]. Dis- charge from these receptors has been measured [10] and it is now thought likely that these signals are used to modify muscle stiffness [11]. It has generally been agreed that the afferent signals controlling joint stability interact in a complex manner within the wider sensorimotor system [12] there is, however, no doubt that they play an important roll in joint control. This is evidenced by tests in cats and humans that have shown that removing or deafferenting these structures can impair joint function [13], [14], [15]. For a full review on the sensory role of crutiate ligaments see Johansson et al [16]. There may therefore be some benefit in incorporating the physical and neurosensory features of the human knee into a robotic knee.
